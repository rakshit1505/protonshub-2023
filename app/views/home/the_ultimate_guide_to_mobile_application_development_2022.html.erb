              <h6>Mobile App Development At Protonshub</h6>
              <h6>Factors That Determine The Cost And Investments</h6>
              <h6>Mobile Devices</h6>
              <p>One of the most important aspects of the<a href="javascript:;">mobile app development </a> process is to create, design, and develop an app that is made for a specific device or vision to develop an app that is device neutral that is the app can be accessed irrespective of the devices and operating systems such as iOS, Android, Microsoft, and the price point highly depends on what sort of application needs to be developed.</p>
              <h6>The Integration Triggers Points</h6>
              <p>Mobile app development is not a stand-alone process, there is much third-party integration to be done before a functional mobile app is developed. Sourcing the right third-party integration tools with the correct API points plays a very important role in determining the cost-effectiveness of mobile application development.</p>
              <h6>User Experience And Visual Efficiency</h6>
              <%= image_tag "visual-efficiency.webp", alt: "User Experience And Visual Efficiency" %>
              <p>The success of a mobile app development largely depends on how effectively the user interacts with the application and there comes the role of the UI/UX design process that determines how complex and friendly the user interface would be.</p>
              <h6>Security And Privacy Parameters</h6>
              <p>Identifying the data security standards in app development and what type of data to be collected also plays an important role in defining the cost. The more complex it is, the more expensive it becomes to develop, test, and manage the application.</p>
              <h6>Factors That Determine The Efficiency Of The Mobile App Development Process</h6>
              <p>Developing a mobile app is a process that has a set life cycle and while setting up the voyage of mobile app development it is very important to understand and set a structured and compliant Mobile App development cascade to ensure the utmost optimization of time, human capital and the outcome expected.</p>
              <p>It is advisable to implicate standard best practices while initiating a mobile application development process.</p>
              <p>So let’s understand in a nutshell the best practices to be considered while you go through the development process.</p>
              <h6>The Planning Phase</h6>
              <%= image_tag "the-planning-phase.webp", alt: "The Planning Phase" %>
              <p>It is said that “planned well is half the job done”. While one undertakes the mobile app development process, it is very important to have a perfectly well-planned and objective-oriented development strategy in place that covers the business-critical aspects of development such as.</p>


              <div class="ph-hireprice-box">
                <ul>
                  <li>Feasibility of the app</li>
                  <li>The target audience</li>
                  <li>Clear business objective and information touch points</li>
                  <li>Market research</li>
                  <li>Business Outcomes</li>
                  <li>It is easier to build an app within the discussed budgets and communicated timelines once the planning phase has all the relevant information well covered, as it provides a guided direction to develop an app that has specified objectives, determined features and set performance parameters.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h6>Map The Requirement</h6>
              <p>Requirement mapping and developing a robust feature list is the next pivotal step in the mobile app development process. Based on the information gathered in the Planning phase, it is important to map various features of the Application with a clear understanding of communication and dependency points to ensure that the application displays the exact response that is aligned with the business outcomes. Some of the important feature elements that need to be taken care of are as follows</p>
              <div class="ph-hireprice-box">
                <ul>
                  <li>Desired feature Elements</li>
                  <li>Payment gateway Integrations</li>
                  <li>Business call-outs</li>
                  <li>Data types to be captured</li>
                  <li>Navigation Integrations</li>
                  <li>The Design Mastery- This is the most attractive and future-defining part of the <a href="javascript:;">mobile App design and development</a> . In this stage, the application receives the identity, a face and shape and a recognition that will be edged in the memory of the users. The core objective of this phase is to design an interactive, intuitive and high-performing structure. The design stage is broadly categorized into 5 major pillars.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h6>Workflow And Architecture Design</h6>
              <p>An app is nothing but a repository of information and in the architecture phase, it is determined where the information resides and how it communicates with users to perform a certain activity.</p>
              <h6>Wireframes! The Look And Feel Of The Application</h6>
              <%= image_tag "wireframes.webp", alt: "Develop The Prototype" %>
              <p>The process of digital replication of the features, workflows, and communication methodology comprises the wireframe design that is most commonly known as the visual architecture of the application.</p>
              <h6>Develop The Prototype</h6>
              <p>Having a first-hand exp of the app while developing helps the mobile app development teams create better and class applications. This is where the working model of the application is designed called the prototype which helps the design team to understand how the end user will feel while using the application.</p>
              <h6>Factors Determining The Development Process</h6>
              <p>After all the hard work right from ideation, design, and prototyping this is where the application development starts, which includes the identification of the technology stack, the tech architecture design, and finally laying down the timelines of the development with milestones of development.</p>
              <p>The development process of a mobile application typically gets completed in 3 major classes:</p>
              <h6>Back-End Development</h6>
              <p>data plays an important role in the performance of the application and in this stage, it is determined where the data will reside, what business logic will communicate with the data with specific workflows and what the possible calculated outcomes will be.</p>
              <h6>API Integrations</h6>
              <p>There is a constant need for a communication protocol between the front end and back end and that will play a mission-critical role.</p>
              <h6>Front End Development</h6>
              <p>Everything that a user will perform and see on the screen is what we call the front end, where the key objective is to ensure that the user has a delightful experience while navigating through the application that will lead to the achievement of successful business outcomes.</p>
              <h6>Factors Determining Accuracy And Sustainability Of The Application</h6>
              <h6>Testing</h6>
              <%= image_tag "testing.webp", alt: "Testing" %>
              <p>Before the launch of the application, it is important to understand the acceptability of the application from a user standpoint and that is where performance and functional testing place a very important part. To ensure that the user has the same intensity of exp as desired in the planning phase, AB testing of similar applications is done to identify the positives and possible negatives so that a remarkable user exp can be created. Some of the important testing activities during this phase are as follows.</p>

              <div class="ph-hireprice-box">
                <ul>
                  <li>User Experience testing</li>
                  <li>Functional testing</li>
                  <li>Performance testing</li>
                  <li>Security testing</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h6>The Deployment</h6>
              <p>Now the Application is gift-wrapped and ready to be gifted to the users and the time has arrived to successfully launch it at the Play store and App store available for the users to download and have the experience that would breeze the business outcomes.</p>
